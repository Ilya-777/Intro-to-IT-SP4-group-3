                  <a href="https://ilya-777.github.io/ePortfolio/">https://ilya-777.github.io/ePortfolio/</a>
                    <p>Ilya Anderson S3760258. I have been working for an oil and gas drilling services provider for the last 13 years in Australia, Brunei, Myanmar, Malaysia, and Thailand where I currently
                       reside with my wife and 6yr old daughter. Due to the oil industry being in decline since 2014, I have been engaged in tertiary studies to help facilitate a career transition to another
                       industry. I first completed a diploma of business at TAFE in 2018 and am now beginning my final year of a business degree in logistics and supply chain management at RMIT. </p>
                    <p>During my careerin the oil industry, I was exposed to IT in the form of PLC driven automated equipment and some networking troubleshooting. My hobbies include riding motorcycle’s around Thailand and
                       tinkering with various IT projects around the house. For example, I recently purchased an old Dell Optiplex PC and upgraded it into a cheap gaming desktop. I also recently made a wireless
                       print server with an old printer and a raspberry pi zero. Another project I am currently working on is an Arduino driven automated greenhouse which is tied to my current university studiest
                       and is also a personal interest. </p>

                    <h3>Jayden Warrell</h3>
                      <p>S3882576 - Hi my name is Jayden Warrell, this is my first course to study through RMIT. To tell you more about myself, I grew and reside in Townsville Northern Queensland. I enjoy gym, athletics and
                      reading within my spare time. Before studying this course my highest achieved education was completing high school in 2014. After school I worked in various roles throughout mining and retail but am now
                      employed in hospitality. <p>I believe my IT experience is at a basic level and limitted to basic hardware & software. Throughout my employment in mining, I have used ERP systems such as pronto and used the
                      programs to communicate safety procedures, stock levels and tasks throughout the company. I have seen directly how efficient information technology can be in a company. I personally believe it will
                      be much more utilized in the future as it develops which I find fascinating. I hope to increase my understanding and build applicable knowledge by participating with Average Joes in our group project. </p>

            <h3>Small computing devices - Raspberry Pi </h3>
            <p>By Ilya Anderson</p>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a low energy consuming, yet high processing powered, Linux based, single board computer roughly the
                 size of a deck of cards that is aimed at students and tech enthusiasts who want to learn about computers and programming.
                 It can be simply connected to a TV, mouse and keyboard and opens the door to computing, programming and development to anyone,
                 even those with no experience, through a vast amount of learning resources provided by its user community (Opensource 2021).
                 It is a part of a group of hugely popular small computing devices including Arduino, Beagleboard and a host of similar products
                 with varying CPU’s that are commonly used as the base of low cost and relatively simple IT projects. The RPi’s development is
                 driven by a charity-based foundation with the goal of:</p>

                 <p>“the ability to deliver computing education without the need for elaborate infrastructure”. (Shah, A 2016). This is achieved
                   through its low-cost hardware and free opensource software. </p>
                   <img src="raspberry pi.png" alt="photo of raspberry pi"/>
                   <p>Raspberry Pi 4 model B (Raspberry Pi, 2021).</p>
                     <h4>How is it cutting edge tech? </h4>
                     <p>First released in 2012, The RPi initially had an ARM based 700MHz single core CPU and 256MB RAM. While this sounds under whelming,
                      it was an instant hit with students, hobbyists, and developers as it cost only $35 and opened the door to anyone wanting to learn
                      programming and development of hardware-based projects (Opensource 2021). It has since increased its computing power capabilities with
                      several product updates due to falling hardware sizes and prices allowing it to maintain its low cost, a key criterion, and further software development.
                      The latest iteration is the Raspberry Pi 4 which has a 1.5 GHz ARM based CPU and 8GB RAM which increases its ability to handle heavier applications, as
                      well as a dedicated 64 bit Linux based RPi OS to take advantage of the RAM increase (Fenlon, W 2020). While the hardware specs are not cutting-edge
                      technology, the RPi’ ability for anyone to “get under the hood” and tinker with IT projects is.</p>

                      <h4>What does it allow us to do?</h4>
                      <p>While the RPi can do usual computer user tasks such as internet browsing, watching videos and word processing and has the usual array of interfaces
                      such as USBs, WIFI, Ethernet, HDMI and Bluetooth it also contains a easily accessible GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins which can be programmed
                      with Scratch, Python or C++ to interact with external hardware and electrical components such as drive motors, LEDs and an array of sensors such as
                      temperature, light, sound, cameras, actuators or radar to name a few (Future Learn 2021). Due to its “back to basics” form and its low price it has broken
                      down barriers to entry into the programming and development world, is a regular inclusion into school computing curriculums and its use has also crossed over
                      into hacking and making communities (Street, M, & Chidlow, W 2020).</p>

                      <h4>What will it allow us to do in the future?</h4>
                      <p>Applications for the RPi are only limited by imagination. It can be used to learn to code or develop electronics projects and is often used as a platform of IoT projects as it contains a microcontroller to process data, Wi-Fi for data transmission and GPIOs for actuator control. Some common projects are: WIFI print servers, ad blocking Pi Hole, streaming device, retro game emulator, WIFI extender, Twitter bot, basic desktop computer, network monitoring tool, smart mirror, NAS (Network Attached Storage) command centre (Locker, A 2021). There is a huge variety of what can be developed with an RPi, and as innovation and development allows the inclusion of higher powered but low-cost CPU’s and other associated hardware, further possibilities will be realised.  </p>
                      <p>The development of the RPi and its support network has also made it feasible to use RPi’s for industrial use in areas such as automation, robotics, and other embedded applications. This has been achieved though the development of the RPi Compute Module which enables rapid prototyping and production of IoT imbedded commercial products (Hallsten Innovations 2021).  <p/>

                      <h4>What is the likely impact of RPI Development? </h4>
                      <p>The RPi is also being used in developing countries where the lack of appropriate educational facilities and infrastructure are some of the leading causes for low education and poverty. The lack of support for computer science education was a problem identified by MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte who with the help of the United Nations Development Program initiated the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. However, this program failed to reach its objective of mass distribution of low-cost laptops to developing countries due to rising costs and other reasons (Shah, N 2020). With the same goal in mind, the RPi was developed with simplicity and low cost being its key features and weighing only 45 grams per unit helped reduce the financial and logistical constraints for developing countries to access technological infrastructure. Additionally, the computer facilitated an easily transported electronic library for providing education in many subject areas (Neupane, S 2015).</p>
                      <h4>What is likely to change?</h4>
                      <p>Increasing performance and falling costs and sizing of hardware links directly with RPi’s success as a small computer. The RPI will also facilitate further interest in IoT embedded systems driven by the need to understand and automate aspects of human interaction with their surroundings such as Smart Homes and Smart Appliances. The reduction in hardware size while increasing capability is the precursor of the future development of nano computers. This will accelerate the inclusion of IoT into many aspects of life.</p>

                      <h4>Will this create or make jobs or technologies redundant?</h4>
                      <p>The RPi’s low cost and ease of use has increased student interest in programming which is evident in over 30 million boards being sold and is also seen in the increase of other manufactures producing similar small computing single boards (Tung, L 2019). The RPi also filled a gap in computers appropriate for beginners to learn coding on because computers today are predominately bought as complex consumer items rather than coding machines, whereas in 80’s, home computers were simple enough to learn programming on by copying codes printed in computer magazines which inevitably required the user to debug and therefore learned programming out of necessity (Two-bit history 2021). </p>

                      <h4>How will I be affected in my daily life?</h4>
                      <p>I was exposed to computers since the early 1980’s with a steady stream of IBM PC’s using intel 8088 microprocessors and onwards and learned some programming by copying games out of computer magazines in Basic and debugged exactly as what was written earlier so I can appreciate the simplicity of the RPI. I hope my daughter can enjoy the simplicity of these small computers and gain an appreciation for IT. I also expect that with the addition of microcomputers and embedded IoT systems into an increasing number of everyday items the efficiency of common tasks will be increased through the minimisation of human involvement. The RPi is still mainly focused on students and enthusiasts, however the growth of RPi for industrial applications may also see it play a role in the lives of friends and family. Small computers are already part of their lives in areas such as monitoring consumer good supply chains, monitoring of buildings and homes, home network devices and TV’s and in processes used in manufacturing consumer goods.</p>
