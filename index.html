                        <h3>Ilya Anderson: S3760258</h3>
                          <p>I have been working for an oil and gas drilling services provider for the last 13 years in Australia, Brunei, Myanmar, Malaysia, and Thailand where I currently
                            reside with my wife and 6yr old daughter. Due to the oil industry being in decline since 2014, I have been engaged in tertiary studies to help facilitate a career transition to another
                            industry. I first completed a diploma of business at TAFE in 2018 and am now beginning my final year of a business degree in logistics and supply chain management at RMIT. </p>
                            <p>During my careerin the oil industry, I was exposed to IT in the form of PLC driven automated equipment and some networking troubleshooting. My hobbies include riding motorcycle’s around Thailand and
                              tinkering with various IT projects around the house. For example, I recently purchased an old Dell Optiplex PC and upgraded it into a cheap gaming desktop. I also recently made a wireless
                              print server with an old printer and a raspberry pi zero. Another project I am currently working on is an Arduino driven automated greenhouse which is tied to my current university studiest
                              and is also a personal interest. </p>

                        <h3>Jayden Warrell: S3882576</h3>
                          <p>this is my first course to study through RMIT. To tell you more about myself, I grew and reside in Townsville Northern Queensland. I enjoy gym, athletics and
                            reading within my spare time. Before studying this course my highest achieved education was completing high school in 2014. After school I worked in various roles throughout mining and retail but am now
                            employed in hospitality.
                            <p>I believe my IT experience is at a basic level and limitted to basic hardware & software. Throughout my employment in mining, I have used ERP systems such as pronto and used the
                              programs to communicate safety procedures, stock levels and tasks throughout the company. I have seen directly how efficient information technology can be in a company. I personally believe it will
                              be much more utilized in the future as it develops which I find fascinating. I hope to increase my understanding and build applicable knowledge by participating with Average Joes in our group project. </p>

                      <h3>Sharif Ayazi: S3815095</h3>
                        <p>I love playing with code and designing. I have finished my diploma and advanced diploma at Chisholm TAFE in Victoria three years ago.  I stopped studying for 2 years and now I am continuing again. I am a full-time employee working at a Vehicle parts supplier company. I have some experience of web design. We are using the Pinnacle system at the current company that I am one of their employees. Pinnacle system is a powerful stock management system which can identify and display all the details of a car from mechanical parts to panels and print tags, scan and display inventoried parts on the website, produce invoices and with many other functions. I start studying IT again to achieve to my goal and make myself more familiar in programming.  </p>

                        <h3>Ben Vaka'uta: S3888875</h3>
                          <p>My wife and I moved to Melbourne from Auckland, NZ in March 2020, and Victoria shut down the borders shortly after that.  I have been in IT for 15yrs, started off from the IT Helpdesk, Desktop Support and now IT Infrastructure Engineer working fulltime.  During the 15yrs in IT I have done self-study for IT related certification to further my career development.  Some of the IT certification that I have completed include CompTIA A+, Network+, Microsoft MCP, Microsoft MCSE, and various Microsoft Servers certification from NT 4.0 to 2012R2.  In the last few years, I have found that my job is shifting a lot from being and IT Admin into a DevOps job which requires programming knowledge.  This include PowerShell, CLI and python, however I have resisted learning new programming language except for PowerShell because some of my daily tasks requires knowledge.  I am not proficient in PowerShell, but I know how to read the help syntax complete the task at hand.  I am taking this degree to have a formal qualification, learn about formal programming and cloud architecture.</p>

                          <h3>Jason Halse: S3882583</h3>
                            <p>I decided I wanted to change careers and so I am doing this course through RMIT. I am a chef by trade and because my circumstances changed i could no longer work in the hospitality industry, since then I have been working as a swimming pool technician, but this is just a job and not a career. I have always had an interest in I.T as I love building, repairing, and troubleshooting all types of technology from computers to kids toys I find myself repairing rather than throwing it away. My main passion has and always will be computers though I am just fascinated in how fast they have and probably will continue to evolve and what we as humans now rely on them to do for us. Although I have no formal experience in I.T I have always fixed and shown family and friends computer and taught them how to best optimise their software and hardware to achieve what they want to do with their systems. I build computers as a hobby and in my job, I am constantly repairing and programming chlorinators which in themselves are just mini computers. I am a very introvert person and hope that having to work within a group like The Average Joes this will help with me being nervous with working in a team.</p>

            <h3>Small computing devices - Raspberry Pi </h3>
            <p>By Ilya Anderson</p>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a low energy consuming, yet high processing powered, Linux based, single board computer roughly the
                 size of a deck of cards that is aimed at students and tech enthusiasts who want to learn about computers and programming.
                 It can be simply connected to a TV, mouse and keyboard and opens the door to computing, programming and development to anyone,
                 even those with no experience, through a vast amount of learning resources provided by its user community (Opensource 2021).
                 It is a part of a group of hugely popular small computing devices including Arduino, Beagleboard and a host of similar products
                 with varying CPU’s that are commonly used as the base of low cost and relatively simple IT projects. The RPi’s development is
                 driven by a charity-based foundation with the goal of:</p>

                 <p>“the ability to deliver computing education without the need for elaborate infrastructure”. (Shah, A 2016). This is achieved
                   through its low-cost hardware and free opensource software. </p>
                   <img src="raspberry pi.png" alt="photo of raspberry pi"/>
                   <p>Raspberry Pi 4 model B (Raspberry Pi, 2021).</p>
                     <h4>How is it cutting edge tech? </h4>
                     <p>First released in 2012, The RPi initially had an ARM based 700MHz single core CPU and 256MB RAM. While this sounds under whelming,
                      it was an instant hit with students, hobbyists, and developers as it cost only $35 and opened the door to anyone wanting to learn
                      programming and development of hardware-based projects (Opensource 2021). It has since increased its computing power capabilities with
                      several product updates due to falling hardware sizes and prices allowing it to maintain its low cost, a key criterion, and further software development.
                      The latest iteration is the Raspberry Pi 4 which has a 1.5 GHz ARM based CPU and 8GB RAM which increases its ability to handle heavier applications, as
                      well as a dedicated 64 bit Linux based RPi OS to take advantage of the RAM increase (Fenlon, W 2020). While the hardware specs are not cutting-edge
                      technology, the RPi’ ability for anyone to “get under the hood” and tinker with IT projects is.</p>

                      <h4>What does it allow us to do?</h4>
                      <p>While the RPi can do usual computer user tasks such as internet browsing, watching videos and word processing and has the usual array of interfaces
                      such as USBs, WIFI, Ethernet, HDMI and Bluetooth it also contains a easily accessible GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins which can be programmed
                      with Scratch, Python or C++ to interact with external hardware and electrical components such as drive motors, LEDs and an array of sensors such as
                      temperature, light, sound, cameras, actuators or radar to name a few (Future Learn 2021). Due to its “back to basics” form and its low price it has broken
                      down barriers to entry into the programming and development world, is a regular inclusion into school computing curriculums and its use has also crossed over
                      into hacking and making communities (Street, M, & Chidlow, W 2020).</p>

                      <h4>What will it allow us to do in the future?</h4>
                      <p>Applications for the RPi are only limited by imagination. It can be used to learn to code or develop electronics projects and is often used as a platform of IoT projects as it contains a microcontroller to process data, Wi-Fi for data transmission and GPIOs for actuator control. Some common projects are: WIFI print servers, ad blocking Pi Hole, streaming device, retro game emulator, WIFI extender, Twitter bot, basic desktop computer, network monitoring tool, smart mirror, NAS (Network Attached Storage) command centre (Locker, A 2021). There is a huge variety of what can be developed with an RPi, and as innovation and development allows the inclusion of higher powered but low-cost CPU’s and other associated hardware, further possibilities will be realised.  </p>
                      <p>The development of the RPi and its support network has also made it feasible to use RPi’s for industrial use in areas such as automation, robotics, and other embedded applications. This has been achieved though the development of the RPi Compute Module which enables rapid prototyping and production of IoT imbedded commercial products (Hallsten Innovations 2021).  <p/>

                      <h4>What is the likely impact of RPI Development? </h4>
                      <p>The RPi is also being used in developing countries where the lack of appropriate educational facilities and infrastructure are some of the leading causes for low education and poverty. The lack of support for computer science education was a problem identified by MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte who with the help of the United Nations Development Program initiated the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. However, this program failed to reach its objective of mass distribution of low-cost laptops to developing countries due to rising costs and other reasons (Shah, N 2020). With the same goal in mind, the RPi was developed with simplicity and low cost being its key features and weighing only 45 grams per unit helped reduce the financial and logistical constraints for developing countries to access technological infrastructure. Additionally, the computer facilitated an easily transported electronic library for providing education in many subject areas (Neupane, S 2015).</p>
                      <h4>What is likely to change?</h4>
                      <p>Increasing performance and falling costs and sizing of hardware links directly with RPi’s success as a small computer. The RPI will also facilitate further interest in IoT embedded systems driven by the need to understand and automate aspects of human interaction with their surroundings such as Smart Homes and Smart Appliances. The reduction in hardware size while increasing capability is the precursor of the future development of nano computers. This will accelerate the inclusion of IoT into many aspects of life.</p>

                      <h4>Will this create or make jobs or technologies redundant?</h4>
                      <p>The RPi’s low cost and ease of use has increased student interest in programming which is evident in over 30 million boards being sold and is also seen in the increase of other manufactures producing similar small computing single boards (Tung, L 2019). The RPi also filled a gap in computers appropriate for beginners to learn coding on because computers today are predominately bought as complex consumer items rather than coding machines, whereas in 80’s, home computers were simple enough to learn programming on by copying codes printed in computer magazines which inevitably required the user to debug and therefore learned programming out of necessity (Two-bit history 2021). </p>

                      <h4>How will I be affected in my daily life?</h4>
                      <p>I was exposed to computers since the early 1980’s with a steady stream of IBM PC’s using intel 8088 microprocessors and onwards and learned some programming by copying games out of computer magazines in Basic and debugged exactly as what was written earlier so I can appreciate the simplicity of the RPI. I hope my daughter can enjoy the simplicity of these small computers and gain an appreciation for IT. I also expect that with the addition of microcomputers and embedded IoT systems into an increasing number of everyday items the efficiency of common tasks will be increased through the minimisation of human involvement. The RPi is still mainly focused on students and enthusiasts, however the growth of RPi for industrial applications may also see it play a role in the lives of friends and family. Small computers are already part of their lives in areas such as monitoring consumer good supply chains, monitoring of buildings and homes, home network devices and TV’s and in processes used in manufacturing consumer goods.</p>

            <h1>Project Ideas - Automated Greenhouse</h1>
            <h1>Monitoring microclimate conditions to increase growth</h1>
            </div>
          <div class="sectionContent">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p> The group project is an automated climate control attachment that can be fitted to small commercially available greenhouses that are approximately 1m x 1m x 1.5m and costing between $30 - $60 at Bunnings and similar big box hardware warehouse.
                The automated control unit is driven by an Arduino microcontroller and contains temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content sensors. These sensors relay information inside the unit to the Arduino which then controls an inlet fan and a water source to maintain predetermined conditions by the user.
                The device is aimed at the gardening enthusiast with the goal to simplify plant care though automation and to provide an ideal growth environment for potted plants. It is simple, low cost, and is portable and lightweight for ease of positioning around the garden or balcony.</p>

              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>The current global pandemic has obligated people to stay at home more and many have turned to hobbies and other housebound activities for entertainment. This is evident with increased revenues from large retailers of household and gardening supplies in Australia  and the booming plant bazaars, nurseries and increases in online sellers throughout Bangkok. The increase in gardening popularity is not only from those with a garden but also from apartment dwellers growing plants indoor or on the balcony. The most popular plants during this period are ornamental due to their beauty and value. These types of plants require extra care to maintain optimal leaf, shoot and root growth with the slightest deviation ruining the appearance of the decorative foliage.
              The automation of garden care processes is possible using inexpensive sensors, microcontrollers and other simple hardware. This allows conditions inside the greenhouse to be monitored and maintained for the users and their plants benefit from the optimal conditions it provides.  </p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Many plants species are grown as a hobby because of their beauty, popularity, and rarity. This rarity is due to not being native to the local environment and are either sourced from other parts of the country or overseas. The problem with growing these types of plants is that local environmental conditions may not be optimal for their growth. Therefore, increased maintenance is required to maintain plant health and a visually appealing foliage.
                  Additionally, free space around the home may be subjected to extremes of sunlight or shade that are unfavourable for growing plants. This is where a controlled environment offered by an automated greenhouse can be a solution. It can increase the range of plant species that can be grown in the local environment and is achieved by tailoring the conditions in the greenhouse specifically to the plant’s requirements. Additionally, potted plants can be cycled through the greenhouse as a nurturing boost before being placed back into areas where they can have maximum viewing pleasure.</p>
                <p>The focus of the project is not on the overall greenhouse structure due to a large variety of small, cheap, and portable versions already available on the marked. The projects focus is to provide an additional unit that can be attached to the front of a prebought greenhouse with simple modifications, connected to a power and water source, and create a stable environment tailored to the user’s requirements.
                  Through automation, the greenhouse will measure the greenhouse conditions and apply resources as required to maintain a predetermined condition. Maintaining soil moisture content is achieved by timing the opening a sprinkler in the early morning or evening as required to increase moisture but not humidity. Humidity is controlled by opening a misting spray during the warmer parts of the day or turning on a ventilation fan. Temperature is controlled by operating a heating lamp or fan, and lighting is controlled by manipulating a shade blind. Soil nutrient content could also be available however the sensor would have to be manually moved from pot to pot. For simplicity, these features can be added or removed as components.  </p>
                  <p>The automation of these processes also allows for the capacity to capture data to SD card or transmit data via WIFI which enables the user to begin with a benchmark and then experiment with different greenhouse conditions to find optimal growth. This information could also be shared with other users of similar systems and open discussions related to best practice or find solutions to remedy problems. Further expansions could be related to web based, monitoring, control, and forum discussion. While the options for variations to parameters are nearly endless, it could include pre-installed settings allowing it for plug and play which would make it more commercially appealing. Condition settings could also be manipulated by enthusiasts to achieve a better outcome or grow a larger variety of species. </p>

                  <h3>Tools & Tech</h3>
                    <p>The automated greenhouse is based on inexpensive kit form greenhouses available at most big box hardware outlets or online retailers. The size is based on the popular 1m x 1m x 1.5 model and could be scaled up slightly to accommodate larger models available such as 1.50m x 1.50m x 1.95m, however retaining a small footprint and portability is one of the key objectives.
                      To monitor the conditions inside the greenhouse, readily available low-cost sensors will be used to measure soil moisture content, humidity, and temperature. (Appendix 1). The sensor data will be input to an Arduino which will then output signals to switch relays which will operate water pumps, water solenoid valves, fan, and a heating lamp. The unit is triangular shaped and is designed to fit into the gable on the front of the greenhouse. This will contain the microcontroller, sensors and relays and the conditions inside will be displayed on the LCD at the front. The soil sensor will be placed in a pot of the user’s choice and misting sprays attached to the top of the greenhouse by the user. Power is supplied by a normal power point, however it could also be adapted to use a battery and solar cell.
                      The unit can be broken down into several components and it is possible to add each component in stages as the user desires. This is simply done by attaching the connectors from the new sensor or other device to the Arduino and updating the firmware via PC.
                      WIFI connectivity is also a planned feature with the addition of the low cost ESP8266 WIFI Module and opens many possibilities for user interaction.</p>

                    <h3>Skills required</h3>
                      <p>The bare greenhouse is a commercially available unit that requires little skill to assemble. The automation module contains the integration of several component projects aimed at IT students and IT enthusiasts. The Arduino and associated sensors and components are available online for little cost.  The Arduino uses C++ programming and while our group lacks the required experience, these products are aimed at beginners and there is a large amount of information available online for free. The project will require basic electronics knowledge for hardware setup to interface the sensor inputs with the Arduino and coding for Arduino to send and receive signals from sensors to servos and switches. An anticipated issue is the soil moisture content will be sensing just one pot in the greenhouse and watering will be based on that one input and may not be a representative of the condition of other pots. It is proposed that the automation unit will be developed in stages as the required competencies are attained.</p>

                      <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>The outcome of a successful project would be a marketable product that could be produced relatively cheaply and allow small hobby gardens to be set up in a variety of small spaces. It could also benefit busy people as it may reduce time needed to maintain a small garden. Additionally, the unit would provide data that is not able to be obtained with normal hands on gardening. The data capture aspect could also help form a gardening community that was interested in a more structured approach that was results driven through benchmarking and measurable improvements. There is also the possibility that it could be scaled to suit much larger applications. </p>
